🔍 KEY FINDINGS & INSIGHTS

🎯 ARCHITECTURE PERFORMANCE:
   • LSTM >> RNN (1-layer) >> MLP
   • Clear hierarchy: Memory-based > Sequential > Feedforward
   • Temporal modeling is CRITICAL for this neural decoding task

📊 DETAILED ANALYSIS:

1. 🔥 LSTM MODELS (EXCELLENT):
   • 1-layer: R² = 0.965, exceptional for simple architecture
   • 2-layer: R² = 0.980, BEST PERFORMANCE - optimal complexity
   • 3-layer: FAILED (gradient issues), early stopping at epoch 49

2. ⚡ RNN MODELS (MIXED):
   • 1-layer: R² = 0.886, good performance, very efficient (7K params)
   • 2-layer & 3-layer: FAILED completely (training instability)

3. 📈 MLP MODELS (MODERATE):
   • All layers: R² ≈ 0.56, consistent but limited
   • No improvement with depth (2-3 layers)
   • Missing temporal dynamics severely limits performance

🚨 TRAINING STABILITY OBSERVATIONS:
   • Multi-layer RNN/LSTM models show training instability
   • Early stopping frequently triggered (epoch 49 for failed models)
