🧠 NEURAL DECODING PROJECT - DAILY PROGRESS SUMMARY
================================================================

📅 Date: Session Summary
🎯 Focus: Baseline Experiment Infrastructure & Bug Fixes

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ ACCOMPLISHMENTS

1. 🐛 FIXED JSON SERIALIZATION ERROR
   • Problem: TypeError with numpy float32 types during results saving
   • Solution: Added convert_to_serializable() function in baseline_trainer.py
   • Result: Converts numpy types to Python native types before JSON export
   • Status: ✅ RESOLVED

2. 🗂️ IMPLEMENTED TIMESTAMPED RESULTS ORGANIZATION
   • Added timestamped directory structure: DD-MM-YYYY--HH-MM-SS
   • Each experiment now gets its own isolated directory
   • Path: results/baseline/{timestamp}/
   • Benefits: Easy comparison between runs, no file conflicts
   • Status: ✅ COMPLETE

3. 📄 ADDED COMPREHENSIVE EXPERIMENT SUMMARIES  
   • New file: experiment_summary.txt in each run directory
   • Contains: timing, dataset info, parameters, results table, best models
   • Captures console logs permanently for review
   • Human-readable format with emojis and clear sections
   • Status: ✅ COMPLETE

4. 🏗️ IMPROVED FILE ORGANIZATION
   • All model files (.pth) now saved in experiment directories
   • baseline_results.json moved to timestamped folders
   • Self-contained experiments with all related files together
   • Status: ✅ COMPLETE

5. 🧠 CLARIFIED NEURAL NETWORK INPUT LAYER ARCHITECTURE
   • Explained different input sizes for different architectures:
     - MLP: 550 features (11 time bins × 50 neurons, flattened)
     - RNN/LSTM: 50 features (per time step, processes 11 steps sequentially)
   • Discussed temporal data handling strategies
   • Status: ✅ EDUCATIONAL
